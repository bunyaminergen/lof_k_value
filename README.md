Determining the Strong Outliers by setting a range to the k-value of Local Outlier Factor

Assigning outliers to detected by the Local Outlier Factor to the nearest neighbor (with iris dataset)
Local Outlier Factor is an unsupervised outlier determination algorithm. Computes the local density deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. Proposed by Markus M. Breunig, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Raymond T. Ng and Jörg Sander in 2000.


Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
As can be seen from the diagram above, the points that are far from the clusters are outliers. To determine these, Local Outlier Factor uses k-distance.
